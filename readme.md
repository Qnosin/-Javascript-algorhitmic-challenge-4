## Javascript algorhitmic challenges #4
fourth exercise of my 100 chalenges in 30 days!!
* Digital root is the recursive sum of all the digits in a number.
* Given n, take the sum of the digits of n. If that value has more than one digit, continue reducing in this way until a single-digit number is produced. The input will be a non-negative integer.

* Examples:
```
16  -->  1 + 6 = 7
   942  -->  9 + 4 + 2 = 15  -->  1 + 5 = 6
132189  -->  1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 8 + 9 = 24  -->  2 + 4 = 6
493193  -->  4 + 9 + 3 + 1 + 9 + 3 = 29  -->  2 + 9 = 11  -->  1 + 1 = 2

```

	
## How to see the results of my solution?
there are 2 ways
* first : install nodeJS for your os from https://nodejs.org/en/download/ and type in terminal or cmd 'node script.js'
* second : copy the file to the javascript tab on https://jsbin.com/?html,js,console,output and see the output in the console tab.
